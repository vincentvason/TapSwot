    cardDescription: "People live their lives in a triple access system, not (only)
      a transport system\r"
    cardBrief: "How people fulfil their access needs and desires is influenced by
      the supply of access opportunity  across transport, land-use and telecommunications
      systems. A planning approach that recognises this is better able to understand
      and shape overall access and the place of mobility within this.\r"

      not exist to support this. To then model multiple \u2018what-if\u2019 futures
      would need more resources and time that could slow the planning process.\r\n"

      can change in unexpected, uncertain ways. Many people shifted significantly
      from a reliance on physical mobility to a greater reliance on digital connectivity.

      implementation may be exposed. Scenario planning allows the plan itself to
      be devised in a way that its creators can ask \u201Cis this part of the plan
      going to work regardless of what the future has to throw at us?\u201D. A policy
      or measure that in any scenario helps progress towards a vision for a better

      transport planning, the picture is less clear in relation to the land-use system
      and even more so in terms of the telecommunications system and its use. The
      three systems and how they are used are interconnected and changing (at different
      rates). Making sense empirically of the Triple Access System is challenging
      (albeit that the TAS exists and affects transport whether sense is made of
      it or not).\r\n\r"

      sustainability and the imperative to urgently address climate change. Giving
      greater emphasis to spatial proximity and digital connectivity in urban mobility
      planning can help reduce dependence upon motorised mobility and especially

      Understandably individuals and organisations have invested in such proficiency

      to blinker how we perceive the present and how best to take steps to shape
      the future. By developing new mental models of the present and future of our
      triple access world it becomes possible to question prior assumptions. It becomes

      may even fall short, there is strength in numbers, strength in conforming with
      norms of practice and norms of professional, public, political expectation.
      In contrast, embracing triple access with vision-led appetite, and addressing
      uncertainty is more novel. The reassurance of others having already tried and

    cardBrief: "Once upon a time it may have seemed that \u2018more of the same\u2019
      car-dependent planning would suffice in a world where road traffic and economic
      output seemed to be tightly coupled. Now the world is changing. Decarbonisation
      demands something different. The digital age may well further transform how
      we live our lives, but in ways that can be hard to imagine. Being able to explore

    cardBrief: "Decision making on policies and investments that shape the future
      is seldom easy for the politicians involved. They are unlikely to welcome any
      suggestion of uncertainty bringing into question their judgement. They may
      wish to assert confidence in more conventional thinking and a belief that primacy
      of motorised mobility will endure. Conversely a vision-led approach in which

    cardBrief: 'The system (or system of systems) of transport and society is a complex
      one in relation to supply and demand. Mobility planning with only a transport
      mindset constraints the ability to make sense of the system that planning seeks
      to shape. A planning approach that considers triple access naturally lends
      itself to bringing transport, spatial and digital planners and other experts
      together. Their shared mental model of the present and future can strengthen
      planning.

      perspective on how and why we plan and how we might plan differently, it also
      demands new skills and processes \u2013 and related capabilities and competencies.
      Being able to co-create a shared triple-access vision, being able to constructively

    cardBrief: "The adage \u2018if you do what you\u2019ve always done you will get
      what you\u2019ve always got\u2019 is pertinent to mobility planning. Whether
      as professionals, politicians or as members of the public, there is a wish
      (albeit not universal) to work with the dynamics of our times to shape a different
      type of future society that supports diversity and prospers while living within
      its means and environmental boundaries. A new approach to planning helps free

      pressures and demands that have been exacerbated significantly by the COVID-19
      pandemic. This can make it difficult to prioritise strategic planning for the
      longer-term. While expectation for onward mobility planning and its delivery
      will exist, this can already be intellectually and procedurally challenging.

      need to plan differently, not least given the imperatives of addressing climate

    cardBrief: "There are many, many factors at play in making sense of the present
      day Triple Access System and its use in a diverse society. The complexity is
      compounded by the challenge of contemplating how and to what extent such factors
      are important in influencing the future. Being able to process this and draw

    cardBrief: "While established planning process and appraisal offer a framework
      for addressing future mobility, it is no longer sufficient to have demonstrated
      accountability in following due process. There is a need for planning that
      helps decision makers to take greater responsibility for charting a course
      ahead that holds the prospect of achieving meaningful change to help address
      environmental and social as well as economic concerns. The approach offered

      access problematic\r"
    cardBrief: "Efforts in the past to more strongly embrace access-based planning
      have proved challenging due to differing perspectives and understandings and
      the difficulty of bringing these together across different jurisdictions of
      responsibility. It is rare for mobility, spatial and digital planning to be
      treated as a combined function. Existing organisational structures may work
      against being able to fulfil such a function.\r\n\r"

    cardBrief: 'The functioning of society and the wellbeing of individuals relies
      upon being able to access people, employment, goods, services and opportunities.
      Motorised mobility is not synonymous with access. It is a means to an end.
      Spatial proximity and especially digital connectivity represent other important
      (complementary) means to that end. Triple Access Planning helps ensure all
      means are drawn upon to help achieve the end in the most appropriate way.

      lives and in this respect can be conceptually very appealing. However, moving
      from the abstract to the specifics of how to observe, understand and influence
      triple access demands more than a new philosophy. It can well demand tools

    cardBrief: "Transport measures within mobility planning have been seen as transport
      solutions addressing a transport problem. Problems more fundamentally relate
      to access, and in this respect a triple access lens can increasingly be used
      to think through the possible consequences of transport measures as part of
      an urban mobility plan \u2013 e.g. road pricing is not just about the choice

      prosperous future by \u2018putting the private car in its place\u2019 in a
      wide repertoire of forms of access. While this may be the case, the sort of

    cardBrief: "Many planning professionals would recognise the merit of being vision-led
      rather than forecast-led, of looking beyond road traffic, and of confronting
      uncertainty. The portrayal of the Triple Access System within which transport
      finds its place and role in access is simple and compelling. As such the new

      and be changed. Research efforts reveal how challenging it is to make sense
      of the System and how its elements interact. As a result, while the new approach

      climate emergency demands that it is shaped in pursuit of a vision that is

      a rethinking and broadening of planning perspective and promotes the need to

      system with mixed experience of engagement with spatial planning. Even more
      remote has been any engagement with evolving expertise in digital planning.
      Added to this is a need for expertise in foresight methods to explore possible
