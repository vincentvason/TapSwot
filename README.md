# TAP-SWOT in a BOX
TAP-SWOT is a serious game that aims to introduce triple access in sustainable urban mobility planning using SWOT analysis. This cooperative card game is separated into several stages to pick the best five cards that constitute the ‘elevator pitch’ of reasoning from the team to support whether or not they recommend TAP be adopted by the organisation concerned.

## Game Introduction
Transport planning has traditionally sat within the predict and provide paradigm – focused upon a forecast-led approach to addressing car-centric planning. Triple Access Planning (TAP), however, offers a different perspective. It sits within the decide and provide paradigm, focusing on a vision-led approach to addressing access-centric planning for an uncertain world.
But what is TAP, and how might it translate from a theoretical concept into the reality of how planning is approached in practice? To delve into this question, we embarked on a journey to develop a game that would not only help practitioners learn more about TAP but also critically examine its merits from their own perspective.
SWOT analysis serves as a powerful tool for critical examination, allowing the strengths and weaknesses of the TAP approach to be considered, along with the opportunities and threats of the planning setting into which it could be introduced. To further our understanding of these SWOT elements and provide a platform for collaborative learning, we conceived the idea of TAP-SWOT in a Box.
TAP-SWOT in a Box is more than just a game; it's an interactive learning experience designed for up to four players. Whether played by multiple teams simultaneously in the same room or online, it's ideal for workshops and conferences alike. The deck of cards features four suits – S, W, O, and T – each containing ten cards. Additionally, blank 'joker' cards are provided, allowing players to introduce new SWOT elements if they wish.
The objective of the game is simple yet profound: work as a team to prioritize the most important SWOT cards until only five remain. These five cards represent the 'elevator pitch' of reasoning from the team to their (imaginary) boss, supporting whether or not they recommend adopting the TAP approach.
Through TAP-SWOT in a Box, practitioners not only deepen their understanding of Triple Access Planning but also engage in meaningful discussions, fostering a collaborative environment where diverse perspectives are valued. As we continue to navigate the complexities of transport planning in an ever-changing world, tools like TAP-SWOT in a Box empower us to explore innovative approaches and shape the future of urban mobility.

## Technology Usage
This game was developed in Unity 2022. This project was created by three people and involved collaboration with the game design team from [TAP with Uncertainty](https://www.tapforuncertainty.eu/).

My responsibilities included designing the user interface, creating motion graphics, and developing animations. My code can be found in the [Animation](https://github.com/vincentvason/TapSwot/tree/main/Assets/Scripts/Animation) folder.

Additionally, I am responsible for UI design.
